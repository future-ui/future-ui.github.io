# Future UI

# What is this book?

This book will explore the state of cutting edge UI/UX
development. We will focus on React, Webpack, both Flux and
"Flux-inspired" architectures, Routing and Universal Applications.

## Tools

The TC39 categorises proposals into 4 stages:

* Stage 0 - Strawman
* Stage 1 - Proposal
* Stage 2 - Draft
* Stage 3 - Candidate
* Stage 4 - Finished

All of the code in this book is written in "future" style using babel
to transpile. By "future", we mean that not only do we get to use
ECMAScript 2015, but we also use more experimental Strawman proposals
as well as some non-spec extensions (for example, extensions made for
minification or React). These are codified as
[babel plugins](http://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/). We do this because
the evolution of the JavaScript language is increasingly being
explored through transpilation and implementation in the wild.

## Code examples

The simple code examples often use @gaearon's
[react-transform-boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate)
which provides a simple base to jump in and explore example code.
